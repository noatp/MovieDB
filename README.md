# MovieDB

This is an iOS app that allows user to discover information of the most popular movies in 2022.

## Description

This app will use URLSession to send HTTP requests to [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover). The API will response with movies paginated into pages of 20 movies each. The app will then use the pages to create an endless scroll experience for user. UI is built with UIKit.
